<p>Our basement is unfinished, dirty, and altogether unpleasing to the eye. The family has decided that we should finish it, and what a better place to start then the rec room. We've planned to add a wall to make it seperate from the main space and make it slightly more secluded and cozy. We also have decided to add wooden flooring and cover up the concrete that sorrounds our entire basement. We would like to add a few shelves that are inlaid into the wall and mount a TV in between them. It was a unanimous decision to add an electric fireplace, although it isn't shown here in the design since we are still wondering if we will have enough space. We only plan to work on this during the weekends, so it will be a slow process, but we won't feel pressured nor exhausted, so we will be able to take our time and enjoy the process!

<p>Here are the electrical plans for the entire finished basement. Our family wish to have potlights to illuminate the basement better than our original florescent tube bulbs. Plus, it gives us a chance to fix some problems we have been experiencing with the current electrical work. For example, the lights can only be turned off from downstairs, leaving you in the dark to find the stairway. This time, we will be able to turn off the entire basement electrical supply with a flick of a switch safely from the top of the stairs. We also wish to add a new electrical fireplace, in replacement of a gas fireplace we had all wanted but was much too expensive. All of this will require the help of my brother, Riley, who is a certified electrician and knows his stuff. That way we get the electrical work for free!
