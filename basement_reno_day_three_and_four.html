Day Three And Four
</h1>
</p>

<p>
These two days were mainly inproductive because we haven't recieved our supplies for the rest of the basement, but mostly since we haven't finsihed the electrical in the basement. And perhaps because we were slightly lazy. We hope to finish the entire basements electrical before drywalling, so it will certainly be awhile before any headway is made on finishing up the rec room. We have only installed the electrical boxes for the first two light switches. The first one is simple, only controlling the lights in the rec room with a simple flip switch, but the second one involves a three-way switch configuration, whatever that means, and will be done by my brother, the electrical handyman. Hopefully he will be able to explain it in more detail when we get around to doing it.
