Recently, while in Toronto, our family had an impulse buy of an electronic fireplace that we all really liked. It's a pretty solid design including two very heavy boards for the top and bottom which was a pain to assemble, but definetly worth it. It holds a quartz fireplace and can heat a 1,000 square foot area, which will be great for the small rec room once it's finished. Currently it's set up in the living room with our Xbox and TV set up while we work on the rec room downstairs. The only problem is this: how will we get it down after we're finished with the recreation room?!
