Day Two
</h1>
</p>

<p>
Today we did some demo! We had to take down the western wall since it was in a state of disrepair too far gone to save. To minimize cleanup, we pulled off the drywall in large chunks so that it would be easier to take up the stairs. We still made a mess, but a lot less if we had completely destroyed the wall. After taking off the drywall, we had to take out every single screw that held them on, leaving a very sore arm afterwards. In the end, we have a clear shot into the laundry room, allowing us to install some new drywall and allow us to cut some better holes for the future shelves.
