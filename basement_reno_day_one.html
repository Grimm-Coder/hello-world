Day One

<p>
Day one of basement renos was a success. We were able to create a wall frame and secure it, but it did take a few tries. We had to place the bottoms of the frames close to where we wanted them, then use a hammer to whack them into place, which took quite a long time. The bottoms are lined with a pink foam to keep the moisture from the floor from rotting the two by fours. Once we had the walls aligned we screwed into the ceiling and into the floor. "But how did you do that?" you may be asking. "The floors are concrete!". Well, it wasn't easy, but we were able to use a drill bit with a spade tip to bite into the concrete, but it got so hot after each use that we needed to use some water to cool it down. After drilling the hole, we only had to use some concrete screws to secure it. While it was a simple enough task, it took us all day, but it was a very eventful one.
